TO FIX

- make bullets die after a few sec

- make sniper only attack once in range



Arduous Abyss


ENEMY IDEAS:

[tronsi]

enemy that spits out small glue drops around it which stay for a short time. If you touch it you get slowed.

enemy that dashes towards player, however before dashing it slows down to "charge up"

enemy that freezes up when you go near it

enemy that sends you back 100 if you touch it

enemy that is small and goes towards player, and then expands.


double sniper, shoots in 2 directions at once at 2 targets. Only shoots 1 shot if theres only 1 player

enemy aura that resets ability cooldown time

necromancer that summons mini homers (minions) around it, with max minion count. Minions will dissappear after a bit.

enemy that has "battery". so as it moves it drains battery, and the less battery the slower, and so it has to recharge.

enemy that patrols entire area (in a predetermined pattern)

figure 8 or infinite enemy

enemy that occasionally sprays bullet in 360

enemy that is immune to slowing effects

enemy that follows behind you (so normal and homing if you're ahead of them)

enemy that shoots bullet that blows you back

enemy that makes other enemies in its aura immune to effects

enemy that buffs speed of enemies in its aura

enemy that sticks to other of the same enemy to make big enemy clumps, which release when they hit a wall or is distrubed

enemy that kills yo u if you touch it for too long

[ADIS PRO IDEA]

enemy that kills u if you're too fast

^ non neutonian enemy from neuid ability

[haha0201]

"slowing" aura, while you're in it you become progressively slower before coming to a halt

machine gun, a very rapidly shooting sniper but with very slow bullets

dropper, drops bullets on the ground as like a path

slower shooter, shoots bullets at you which slow you down by 1/2 for 2 seconds (less op ice sniper)

enemy with aura that kills you (hitboxes with sides of walls and stuff are smaller so its not just a big enemy)

ellipse enemy tronsi's note: not practical collisions too hard need calculus

enemy with an orbital rotating around it

enemy which eats projectiles shot by u (troll necro hehe)

enemy which becomes bigger and slower if you're closer to it (opposite of liquid)

enemy which explodes every 3 seconds, becoming 3x bigger and then resetting to its original size. growth is sped up if its bigger so it looks like its constantly exploding

enemy with a predetermined path like the world's hardest game 

enemy which makes you slowly become progressively bigger in a radius of it

enemy which becomes bigger if players are near it (expanding)

enemies which bounce off other enemies

enemy which makes other enemies in an aura of it bigger

[in evades alrdy but to be added]

corrosive enemy, ignores invincibility effects (to troll ptah and neuid)




Optimization:
remove the key and stuff of worlds from the enemies{} object whe nthey're not in use, that way you dont waste time looping them


use switch statements instead of a ton of if statements
